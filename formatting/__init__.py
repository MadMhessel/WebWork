"""Utility helpers for preparing text for Telegram HTML mode.

The real project contains a rather involved formatting module.  For the
purposes of the tests in this kata we only need a tiny subset of that
behaviour: escaping unsafe characters, stripping unsupported tags and
truncating text by character count.  The functions implemented here are
intentionally small but well documented and type annotated which makes them
easy to unit test and reuse.
